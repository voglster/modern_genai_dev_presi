# GenAI and Software Development

## Introduction
- GenAI/LLMs as leverage tools for developers
  - AI provides leverage - amplifying developer capabilities
  - Monitor/computer analogy: low gains for slow workers, high gains for fast workers
  - The same principle applies with AI tools in development
- The amplification effect
  - AI magnifies both skills and mistakes
  - Junior developers: mistakes get amplified
  - Senior developers: 4-10x speedup with careful use
- How AI is changing the development landscape
  - Modern development becoming conversational with your codebase
  - Development shifting from memorization to systems thinking

## Rapid Prototyping with AI
- Case study: Mathematical formula visualization tool
  - How AI accelerated backend-to-frontend development
  - Transforming complex ideas into interactive prototypes
- Live demo: Frontend development assistance for backend developers
  - Using Claude to generate React components from mockups
  - UI generation from descriptions/examples
- Getting stakeholder feedback faster
  - Reducing time from idea to interactive prototype
  - Example: "Stakeholders asked why I was wasting time, now they can't live without it"
- Knowledge democratization
  - No need to memorize esoteric syntax (MongoDB, Prolog, etc.)
  - AI as "the best tutor in the world"

## The Complexity Gap
- Demo: AI success vs failure based on request complexity
  - Simple tasks: high success rate
  - Complex tasks: dramatic drop-off in success
- Breaking down complex problems into AI-solvable chunks
  - Example: MongoDB aggregation vs full-stack solution
  - Using your "inductive bias" to decompose problems
  - AI helps with individual steps, not end-to-end solutions
- The complexity vs success rate curve
  - How model size affects the inflection point
  - 18B parameter model vs Claude capabilities
- Practical techniques for managing AI's limitations
  - Keep knowledge gaps small and specific
  - Focus on knowledge-based gaps, not logical gaps

## Modern AI-Enhanced Development Workflows
- Code generation and review with AI
  - Demo of effective prompts:
    - "Imagine you are a senior dev focusing on code readability five years down the road..."
    - "Explain all test cases I should consider, especially edge cases..."
  - Using AI to review junior dev code
- Model Context Protocol
  - Open standard for connecting LLMs to tools
  - Architecture overview
  - Examples of MCP servers:
    - Filesystem
    - Jira
    - Notion
    - RAG models
    - Qdrant
  - How MCP transforms development workflows
- Integration with development tools
  - Cursor + Claude integration
  - Claude artifacts
  - Projects and organization capabilities
  - Other tools worth exploring (Qwen-coder for self-hosted)

## Team and Career Impact
- Leveraging AI within development teams
  - Approaches for different team roles
  - Code review enhancement for senior developers
- Knowledge democratization and team efficiency
  - Reducing knowledge silos
  - Accelerating onboarding
- "AI isn't coming for your job, but developers who use AI effectively might be"
  - The competitive advantage of AI fluency
- The future of software development
  - Smaller teams accomplishing what required many developers
  - High-impact, self-motivated individuals doing more
  - Shifting skill requirements and team structures

## Q&A and Discussion
- Open discussion
- Additional resources and next steps

## Notes for Development
- Add concrete examples of AI amplifying both good practices and mistakes
- Develop demonstrations showing AI successes vs failures based on complexity
- Create case study showing problem decomposition approach
- Include live coding examples using Claude or offline models/agents
