# What if I told you...

<v-click>

## We reduced our daily standups from 30 minutes to 5?

</v-click>

<v-click>

## And made them MORE effective?

</v-click>

<v-click>

## With an AI that never forgets to ask for updates?

# The Standup Bot Story

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## Before AI 🥱
- 30-minute daily standups
- Chasing updates manually
- Forgetting to update tickets
- Context switching disruption
- Team frustration

</div>
<div v-click>

## After AI 🚀
- 5-minute sync-ups
- Automated Jira watching
- Slack reminders at day's end
- Morning summaries ready
- Listen during coffee ☕

</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="mt-8 text-center text-2xl">
Result: 25 minutes saved daily × 5 devs = <span class="text-green-400 font-bold">10+ hours/week</span>
</div>

<!--
This is a concrete example they can relate to.
Emphasize the time savings and reduced friction.
The bot does the annoying parts, humans do the thinking.
Note: I even added text-to-speech so I can listen during coffee!

# My AI Journey

<v-clicks>

- **Started with Stable Diffusion** - Fascinated by AI art generation
- **Simple automations** - Vim hotkeys, code review scripts
- **Growing sophistication** - As models improved, so did my usage
- **Now: Full AI orchestration** - Agents that handle entire workflows

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## The Key Insight
> "I'm 10x more productive, happier, and focused on what matters"

</v-click>

<!--
Personal story builds credibility.
Show the progression - anyone can follow this path.
Emphasize happiness - it's not just about productivity.

# Software ≠ Just Code

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">
<div>

## The Full Journey
<v-clicks>

- **Ideas** → Requirements
- **Stories** → Understanding  
- **Problem solving** → Architecture
- **Team communication** → Coordination
- **Testing** → Quality assurance
- **Documentation** → Knowledge transfer
- **Deployment** → Customer value

</v-clicks>

</div>
<div>

<v-click>

## Where LLMs Excel
- **Language** understanding
- **Communication** enhancement
- **Documentation** generation
- **Story** clarification
- **Problem** breakdown
- **Team** coordination

</v-click>

<v-click>

### The Reality
Code is maybe **20%** of the software journey

# Part 1: The New Reality

<div class="text-6xl font-bold gradient-text">
The Cost of Software is Cratering

<!--
Dramatic pause here.
This is the big strategic insight for managers.

# The Cost Revolution

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 h-4/5">
<div>

## Traditional Development
- High cost per line of code
- Precious, must be protected
- Months to refactor
- Fear of change

<v-click>

## AI-Enhanced Development
- Near-zero marginal cost
- Disposable and replaceable
- Hours to rewrite
- Embrace change

</div>

<!--
This is the strategic message for managers.
Software used to be expensive to create and change.
Now it's cheap - this changes EVERYTHING.
The window won't stay open forever.

# One-Person Companies Are Real

<v-clicks>

- **I have an army** - Junior devs and support staff at my fingertips
- **24/7 availability** - AI doesn't sleep
- **Instant scaling** - Need 10x output? Just parallelize
- **Quality + Speed** - No longer a tradeoff

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## Real Example
Built a complete analytics agent in 20 minutes during a client call:
- SQL queries
- Data visualization
- Analysis reports  
- Slack integration

Client reaction: "**Dumbfounded it was that easy**"

</v-click>

<!--
This challenges their assumptions about team size.
The 20-minute demo story is powerful - use it.

# The 10x Developer is Real

But not what you think...

::left::

## It's NOT About:
- Typing faster
- Working longer hours
- Being a "genius"
- Writing more code

::right::

<v-click>

## It's About:
- Eliminating friction
- Focusing on value
- Automating repetition
- Thinking strategically

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-12 col-span-2">

## My Favorite Example
"I'm not the bad guy anymore - my bot handles code reviews!"

</div>

<!--
Dispel the myth of the 10x developer.
It's about leverage, not superhuman abilities.

# From Napkin to Prototype

<v-clicks>

- **Draw on napkin** (or Excalidraw)
- **Photo → AI** with vision capabilities
- **Specify tools** - "Use React + Tailwind"
- **Get working UI** in minutes

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## The Magic:
AI understands design systems and component libraries

## The Result:
Clients can "play with it" immediately

# Think in Systems

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## Example: Code Coverage Bot

**Goal:** Keep coverage above 60%

**System Steps:**
1. Watch commits
2. Analyze coverage delta
3. Suggest tests
4. Notify on Slack
5. Track improvements

</div>
<div v-click>

## Why This Works

- Each step is measurable
- Clear inputs/outputs
- No ambiguity
- Easy to debug
- Humor helps! 😄

> "Your commit dropped coverage by 5%. The bot is disappointed. 🤖"

</div>
</div>

<!--
Systems thinking + AI = powerful automation.
Note the humor - makes the bot feel less threatening.
Break complex problems into simple, measurable steps.

# Warning Signs for Managers

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

<v-clicks>

1. **Developers can't explain their code**
   - Red flag: "The AI wrote it"
   - Good sign: "I used AI to implement my design"

2. **No code reviews happening**
   - AI doesn't replace human judgment
   - Reviews catch conceptual issues

</v-clicks>

</div>
<div>

<v-clicks>

3. **Velocity without understanding**
   - Moving fast in wrong direction
   - Technical debt accumulation

4. **Over-reliance indicators**
   - Can't debug without AI
   - No architectural thinking

# Prompt Engineering 101

<div class="text-center text-2xl mb-8">
"Make the LLM interview you"
</div>

<v-clicks>

- **Don't just ask** - Have a conversation
- **Provide context** - Background, constraints, goals
- **Iterate** - First output is rarely final
- **Teach your style** - Share examples of good output

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## Example Progression:
1. ❌ "Build me a dashboard"
2. ✅ "I need a dashboard for oil & gas metrics"
3. 🚀 "Here's our design system, build a dashboard showing production metrics with these specific KPIs..."

<v-clicks>

- **What:** Standardized way for AI to use tools
- **Why:** AI can interact with your actual systems
- **Example:** AI reads Jira → updates tickets → notifies Slack

<v-click>

## The Power:
Instead of copy-pasting, AI directly integrates with your workflow

# Key Takeaways

<v-clicks>

1. **AI won't replace developers**  
   But developers using AI will replace those who don't

2. **The cost of software has cratered**  
   Massive opportunities for those who adapt

3. **It's about amplification, not replacement**  
   10x productivity is real and achievable

4. **Start small, think in systems**  
   Even simple automations compound

5. **The time is NOW**  
   Early movers have exponential advantages
